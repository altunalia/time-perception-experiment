# time-perception-experiment
This is an experiment program created in PyschoPy to be used for an academic research in Cognitive Psychology.
In my case, I used it for conducting a research within the scope of Research Skills course, at 2019 in my undergraduate education. 
Stimuli items in the folder were produced in Adobe After Effects as a short animation videos. 
fyi: The language of the experiment is Turkish due to our target group.
